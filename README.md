# End-to-End Supply Chain Analytics Project

Supply chain analytics is a valuable part of data-driven decision-making in industries such as manufacturing, retail, healthcare, and logistics.  
This project focuses on collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data related to the movement of products and services from suppliers to customers.

## 📄 Abstract

Supply chain analytics enables organizations to optimize their operations by leveraging data.  
This involves tracking products from suppliers to end customers and using insights to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and boost customer satisfaction.

## 🧾 Dataset Features

The dataset includes:
- Product Type
- SKU
- Price
- Availability
- Number of products sold
- Revenue generated
- Customer demographics
- Stock levels
- Lead times
- Order quantities
- Shipping times
- Shipping carriers
- Shipping costs
- Supplier name
- Location
- Production volumes
- Manufacturing lead time
- Manufacturing costs
- Inspection results
- Defect rates
- Transportation modes
- Routes
- Costs

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Data Exploration:**  
  Gain insights into production volumes, stock levels, order quantities, revenue, costs, lead times, shipping costs, transportation routes, risks, and sustainability factors.
- **Visualization:**  
  Create informative visualizations to understand relationships and distributions within the supply chain data.
- **Dashboard Development:**  
  Build a Power BI dashboard and PDF report to visualize key metrics and facilitate real-time analysis.

---

## 🛠️ Approach

- Ensured data accuracy and consistency
- Evaluated revenue trends to identify high-performing products and locations
- Assessed total quantity sold to monitor demand and supply
- Measured and optimized lead times across the supply chain
- Maintained optimal inventory levels to balance supply and demand

---

## 🧮 SQL Analysis

A comprehensive set of SQL queries was used for data exploration and insight generation, including:
- Total and location-wise revenue
- Product-wise revenue analysis
- Revenue contribution percentage
- Quantity sold by product and location
- Stock levels and lead times
- Route and transport analysis
- Defect rates and inspection results
- Cost and manufacturing metrics
- Inventory management (stock turnover, reorder point, safety stock)
- Shipping cost analysis

> See **SQLQuery1.sql** for all queries.

## 🖥️ Visualizations & Dashboard

- **Power BI Dashboard:** Visualizes key supply chain metrics and trends.
- **PDF Report:** Summary of dashboard findings (`supply chain Dashboard.pdf`).
